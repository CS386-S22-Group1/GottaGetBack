# 5. MVP
For our minimum viable product we plan on making a very bare bones prototype that is playable. It will contain the ability to move around, shoot enemies,
 destroy enemies and have the ability for multiplayer. Some others things may be added in for testing such as respawning to make our lives and the testers life
 easier but respawing isn'tconsidered a core part of the game. Very minimum art will be included, mainly so the player can see where the eneimes are, identify the
 boundries of the map,idenify players location as well as any friends locations, and any projectile locations. We plan on validating this MVP by doing play tests.
 From this we should we able to idenifty what else needs to be included to make our core game fun as well as identify what we can remove from our MVP to make it
 still fun.
