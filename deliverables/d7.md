# Deliverable 7 (Verification & Validation)

## Description
Gotta Get Back is a topdown dungeon crawler roguelike that provides gamers, who are fans of the roguelike genre, a captivating roguelike experience that also immerses the user in a charming story.
Or at least, that would be our final goal in terms of delivering a value. Of course, while we have yet to implement most of the features to deliver such a value, the features in our current system are as follows.
Currently, our game loop consists of a white square with a gun, controlled by the player, fending off red enemy squares, controlled by the enemy AI system, that periodically spawn as waves attempting to defeat the player.
Moreover, our system has multiplayer capabilities that allow players to host or join a game session, all through a simple menu.

## Verification (Tests)
### Unit Test
- Unity has a built in unit testing system called test runner that we are using to make our unit tests.
- https://github.com/CS386-S22-Group1/cs386-project/tree/main/GottaGetBack/Assets/Tests
- We have a unit test to test that our starting positons for the player should be zeroed out as well as the intial x and y input are zeroed out.
