## Design Principles

### - Single responsibility principle
- We can see our game following the practice of single responsibility if we take a look at our player class. In our player class we only have things pertaining to stats of the characters, such as health, armor, damage and movement speed. While others elements can be added to our player class we would start escaping single responsibility. Such as if we added movement to the player in the player class. While this may seem like a good idea at first since our player has the option to move we have now introduced the player class containing being responable of stats for the player and responable for moving the player. We can see here this is two responables and not one. For movement we have a scirpt that can be attached to our player instead, which allows us not only to have clear sepration of responsibilites but promotes moduliarty since we can reuse the movement script if needed.

### - Open/closed principle
- An example of open close can also be seen with our player prefab. Our player prefab at it's core is just a rigidbody that we are able to extend with other scripts. We've extened the prefab to the point where it can move, shoot, and have a connection to a server. So while we are able to keep our player open and allow extensions were are also not allowing the rigid body to be directly modified. 

### - Liskov substitution principle
- We can see the Liskov substitution princle being used in our player prefab and enemy prefab. They both inhereit from the character class but have there own unquie classes. We are able to swap these subtypes and not having any conflicting issues since both of these classes only extend off of the character and do not direclty change or modify the character class.

### - Interface segregation principle
- Once again with our charcter class, enemy class and player class we have only the nessicaities for each class. The character class does not extend any functionailty that the player class would not use and the same goes for the enenmy class. 

### - Dependency inversion principle
