# Project AOTF - Deliverable 5 (Design)

## Description
Gotta Get Back is a 2D top-down game built using the Unity game framework. Gotta Get Back is a dungeon style game where players can explore an open world map and complete different quests.
By using the Unity framework we were able to easily create new game objects as well as build on code made available to us through the Unity community. The Unity framework uses the C# programming
lanaguage which allows all of our team members to assist with coding because C# is a OOP language very similar to Java which we had all used from courses at NAU. Unity simplipies the integration 
between the functional and artistic portions of our project and allows us to easily get an overview of our project in an easy-to-use visual editor. 

Because Unity uses C#, an OOP based language, we were able to easily apply many of the design principles being discussed in class. Unity allows us to link C# files to certain game objects which allows
us to easily break code out into smaller, more managible files or segments. Priniples of OOP allow us to easily create interfaces for common components such as a player or enemy because these objects
share many of the same properties and functions.

### Use Case: Shoot Ranged Weapon
**Actor:** Player

**Description:** The player presses the attack button to shoot a projectile from their ranged weapon.

**Preconditions:** The player has a ranged weaponed equiped with ammo left.

**Postconditions:** A projectile is launched from the ranged weapon.

**Main Flow:**

1. The player equips a weapon of ranged type.

2. The system checks off the weapon's equiped flag.

3. The player presses the attack button.

4. The system spawns a projectile with a set of values (damage, time, range)

5. The projectile flies across the screen.

**Alternate flows:**

4a. The weapon has no ammo left.

5. The player reloads the ranged weapon.

6. The use case starts over.
