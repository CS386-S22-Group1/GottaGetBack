## Code Quality

#### Policies
Our general policy involved writing code in the interest of getting a working product. This means everyone was able to write with their own style; however, an emphasis was put on the 80 characters per line limit we have been practicing at NAU thus far.

In the event that a line was needed to be broken up:
- mathematical operations should be broken up at the operator, or before; character limit permiting
- conditionals should be broken up at or before the conditional operator; character limit permiting
- method and constructor calls were to be broken up at the comma

#### Conventions
Since we were working with the Unity Necode solution to attain a multiplayer game, we adopted the convention for Server RPC and Client RPC methods.
- Client RPC methods should end with "ClientRpc"
- Server RPC methods should end with "ServerRpc"

#### Best Practices
Variables:
- All variables needed for a class were to be declared and/or initialized at the beginning of the class
  
- All varaibles needed to have a short description of their place/use by the class, as well as any other information that may be helpful in idnetifying
  their use
  
- Variables should be grouped by their place; for example, all timers should be grouped together, and be headed under "Timers"; or something of that
  nature
  
Custom Methods:
- All custom methods were to be declared and/or implemented below any implementation of Unity's defined methods, such as "Start()" and "Update()"

- All custom methods were to be ordered by name, in alphabetical order

- All custom methods should be documented with a short description of their place in the class, as well as any remarks from the programmer; and every
  method should have a short description of their parameters
