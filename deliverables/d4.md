In the demo video, presented by Asa Henry, it is shown how a player is able to use a simple UI from the "Building on 'Hello World'" tutorial that Unity Netcode team created to start a "Host", a "Client", or a "Server" instance.

Preceeding through the video, the first thing that is pointed out is the consistency between the Host and Client instnaces. Both instances show the Host and Client player objects; and when an enemy is on the screen of one player, the other is also able to see it, and it's position is consistent across both instances.

Looking further into this, Asa explains, in some detail, that the group developed an enemy spawning system the implements enemy waves, similar to something you might see is Call of Duty zombies, and this is to help players not become overwhelmed by enemies as they test and play.

Talking further, it is also shown off how enemies are able to target a player, and which player they are focused on is indicated by their rotation. As well as, how they move across the world space.

Penultimately, player engagement with enemies is far from complete. Most notably from the video, the rotation of the player object is fixed, facing in the positive x-direction. At one point, we had the player object tracking the mouse; however, when trying to implement this just for the Host, it became apparent that Unity was incorrectly having the player object track the camera that was intentended to capture mouse position, and translate that to a position in world space. Very annoying, as mentioned, but this will definitely be a top priority for our next version. Additionally, we tried to apply the same technique for single player when translating to multiplayer, so that could have been a massive problem.

Finally, ranged weapons are discussed; more specificall, how ranged weapons have a set number of "bullets" or "pellets" to launch before having to reload. In the future, idealy the player would have some sort of UI to count their remaining pellets before having to reload.

As an after thought, respawning was implemented; however, over the course of the past couple of days, respawning was turned off and fell to the way side in favor of getting the Host and Client instances to match up, and to implement enemy spawning. In future version, if a player would be defeated by an enemy, a respawn button would be presented to them; therefore, allowing the player to rejoin the session.
