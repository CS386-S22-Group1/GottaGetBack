# Deliverable 4

## Intriduction

## Implementation Requirements

## Tests
- Unity has a built in unit testing system called test runner that we are using to make our unit tests.
- https://github.com/CS386-S22-Group1/cs386-project/tree/main/GottaGetBack/Assets/Tests
- We have a unit test to test that our starting positons for the player should be zeroed out as well as the intial x and y input are zeroed out.

## Look & Feel
- As of right now our MVP is very simple in terms of design and apperance. We wanted to keep our design very minimal and simple so after we have made an MVP that has a solid base we could start working to add sprites/tilemaps/animations and other elements to give the game a more unquie and sytlized fell. For the actual feel we worked on giving the user a very smooth feeling when using the player character. Again we didn't want to make too many choices early on so we gave our player simple but smooth movement and a projectile that has a simple projectile. We plan on our next build making our player have a more stylized fell and design.
