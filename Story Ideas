Premise:
4 teens from 1976 come across a strange machine while on a walk through the woods. 
As they enter the machine, one of the teens hit a button, transporting them through
space and time. As they arrive at their new destination, the machine beeps and 
displays a low power icon. Trapped in this new time, the teens must restore power 
to the time machine and return home to their own time.
