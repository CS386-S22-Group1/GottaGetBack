### Collisons 
### The tile palette has two different tile maps. 

Both of these tile maps are identical in terms of there sprite sheets but differ in how collison boxes are
applied to them.

One of the tile map's is called "Ground" which contains no hitboxs for all the tiles.

The other tile map is called "Top" which contains hitboxes for all the tiles.

An example of how to use these tilemaps would be to place all ground tiles while using the Ground tile map so our
player is able to move freely. Then we would place walls or other barriers using the Top tile map in order to restrict 
where our player can move.

Let me know if you have any questions
